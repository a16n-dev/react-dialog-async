Version 2.5.0 for React Dialog Async has been released ðŸŽ‰
<!-- truncate -->

## What's new?
* Dialogs are now wrapped in a provider that exposes all of the props passed to the dialog component via react context. Call `useDialogContext` from a component inside a dialog to access all the dialog props such as `open`, `data`, and `handleClose`. [Read more about `useDialogContext`](/API/use-dialog-context).
