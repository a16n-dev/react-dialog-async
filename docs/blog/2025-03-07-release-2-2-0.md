Version 2.2.0 for React Dialog Async has been released ðŸŽ‰

This release introduces the `DialogOutlet` component for solving issues with nested providers!
<!-- truncate -->

## What's new?
* Previously, dialogs were rendered as direct children of the `DialogProvider`. Now you can use a `DialogOutlet` to instead render dialogs in a different place in the component tree  ([More details](/API/dialog-outlet))
* Internal performance optimisations
