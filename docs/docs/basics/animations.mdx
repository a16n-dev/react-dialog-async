# Animations
It's a common UI pattern for dialogs to have entry and exit animations. By default, exit animations won't work with
`react-dialog-async` because the dialog is unmounted immediately after it's closed.

## Unmount Delay

To give your animations time to play,
`useDialog` exposes an `unmountDelayInMs` option:


```tsx
const myDialog = useDialog(AnimatedDialog, {
  unmountDelayInMs: 500, // wait 500ms after the dialog is closed
});
```

:::note
Note that the promise returned by `show` will resolve immediately after the dialog is closed and is not affected by the delay.
:::

## Global Unmount Delay
If your app has a common dialog component, you'll likely want the same unmount delay across all dialogs.

To avoid having to specify it every time, you can pass a `defaultUnmountDelayInMs` prop to `DialogProvider` to set a default unmount delay for all dialogs:

```tsx
<DialogProvider defaultUnmountDelayInMs={500}>
  {...}
</DialogProvider>

:::tip
Generally, there is little to no downside to having a delayed unmount so we recommend setting a global value of `1000` or similar, even if not all of your dialogs need it
