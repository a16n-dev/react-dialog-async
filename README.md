# Installation

Install the package into your project:

```

## Why use React Dialog Async?

Here's an example of how you might use it to show a confirmation dialog in response to a user action:

```tsx
import { useDialog } from 'react-dialog-async';

const DeleteItemButton = () => {
  const dialog = useDialog(ConfirmationDialog);

  const handleDelete = async () => {
     const result = await dialog.open({
       message: "Are you sure you want to delete this item?"
     });

     if(result?.confirmed) {
       deleteItem();
     }
  }

  return (
    <Button onClick={handleDelete}>
      Delete item
    </Button>
  );
}
```
