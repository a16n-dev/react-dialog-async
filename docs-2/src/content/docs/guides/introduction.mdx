React Dialog Async provides a simple hook-based API for managing dialog state in React apps.
It keeps dialogs out of component rendering, and lets data easily flow in and out of dialogs.

## Benefits

* ✅ CSS Framework agnostic - works with any component library or CSS setup

* ✅ Lightweight with zero dependencies

* ✅ Written in Typescript

* ✅ Supports both React and React Native

## Why use React Dialog Async?

Consider this simple component that shows a dialog when a button is pressed:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <MyDialog open={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)} />
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>
        Show dialog
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

✅ This can be simplified by using React Dialog Async:

```tsx
import { useDialog } from 'react-dialog-async';

function MyComponent() {
  const dialog = useDialog(MyDialog);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => dialog.open()}>
      Show dialog
    </button>
  );
}
```
