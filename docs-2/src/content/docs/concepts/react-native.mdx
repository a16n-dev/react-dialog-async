React Dialog Async supports React Native out of the box with no additional configuration, as it does not have any dependency on `react-dom`. 

## Native Dialog Components

See the [Recommended UI Libraries section](/concepts/creating-dialog-components#recommended-ui-libraries) for suggestions on dialog components for React Native.

## Portal Behaviour
One of the main challenges with creating custom dialogs in React Native is the lack of an equivalent to `createPortal` from `react-dom`. React Dialog Async solves this in most cases with the `<DialogOutlet/>` component, as it can be placed outside of your main app component, allowing dialogs to be rendered above all other content.

```tsx title="main.tsx" {5}
const Main = () => {
  return (
    <DialogProvider>    
      <App />
      <DialogOutlet/> {/* <-- Dialogs will be rendered here */}
    </DialogProvider>
  )
}
```

<Aside type={"caution"} title={"Portal Behaviour with <StaticDialog/>"}>
  Note that dialogs rendered with `<StaticDialog/>` **do not** use `<DialogOutlet/>`, and will be rendered in place.

  In this case you may need to provide your own portal behaviour, for example by using a library such as [@gorhom/portal](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-portal).
