React Dialog Async is designed with performance in mind, ensuring that no part of your component tree is re-rendered when a dialog is opened or closed. It also has support for lazy loading.

# Minimising re-renders

Components that use the `useDialog` hook will never re-render in response to a dialog being opened or closed. This is because the state is managed at the DialogProvider level, and the `useDialog` hook intentionally does not expose any state information.

## Lazy Loading

Dialogs are often a good candidate for lazy loading, as they are often not immediately visible when a page loads. React Dialog Async supports this pattern via the `useDialogLazy()` hook.

<Aside>
`useDialogLazy()` is intended to be used only when necessary. `useDialog()` should be sufficient for most use cases.
