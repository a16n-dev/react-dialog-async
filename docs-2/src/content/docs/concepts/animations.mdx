title: Animations
---

It's a common UI pattern for dialogs to have entry and exit animations. In order to support exit animations,
React Dialog Async will not unmount the dialog immediately after it is closed.

By default, this delay is set to `500ms`, which should be sufficient for most use cases. Generally exit animations are recommended to be under 150-200ms

:::note
Note that the promise returned by `dialog.open()` will still resolve immediately after the dialog is closed and is not affected by the delay.

## Configuring the Unmount Delay

You can configure this delay by setting `unmountDelayInMs` in the options passed to `useDialog`:

```tsx {2}
const animatedDialog = useDialog(AnimatedDialog, {
  unmountDelayInMs: 200,
});
```



## Configuring the Unmount Delay Globally

In most cases, you'll want to adjust the unmount delay globally to match the animation speed of some standard component. You can do this by setting the `defaultUnmountDelayInMs` prop on `DialogProvider`:

```tsx
<DialogProvider defaultUnmountDelayInMs={200}>
```

## Disabling the Unmount Delay

If your dialogs do not animate, you may choose to disable the unmount delay entirely by setting it to `0`:

```tsx
<DialogProvider defaultUnmountDelayInMs={0}>
```

:::tip
While the timing is generally accurate, we suggest adding a small buffer to the delay to avoid animations being cut off.
