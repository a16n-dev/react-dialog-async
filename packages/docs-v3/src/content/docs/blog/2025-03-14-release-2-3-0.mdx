Version 2.3.0 for React Dialog Async has been released ðŸŽ‰

## What's new?
* Introduces a new option that can be passed to `useDialog`; `hideOnHookUnmount`. This option allows you to prevent dialogs being hidden when `useDialog()` unmounts, which is useful if you want to show a dialog from a toast or other short-lived component. ([More details](/API/use-dialog))
