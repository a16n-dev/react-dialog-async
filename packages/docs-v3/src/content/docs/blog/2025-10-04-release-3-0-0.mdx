Version 3.0.0 for React Dialog Async has been released ðŸŽ‰

## Why V3?
React Dialog Async started out as a small library for personal use, first published over 4 years ago. At the time I was focused
on a small set of features for solving my own personal use case. Over time it's grown to support a wider range of use cases, but
the core API has remained largely unchanged since day one.

Over time as the library has matured, I've started to disagree with some of the original decisions I made. I've held off making
any breaking changes, but I feel that now is the right time to pay down some technical debt, and bundle all of the breaking changes
together into a newer, more polished version of the library.

## What's new?

- New `useDialogLazy()` hook that supports bundle splitting dialogs. Read the [docs here](/concepts/performance/#lazy-loading), or check out the [API reference](/reference/hooks/use-dialog-lazy).

- New `<StaticDialog/>` component for rendering dialogs created for `useDialog()` statically in JSX. [API reference](/reference/components/static-dialog)

## Breaking changes

There are a number of breaking changes in this release. Please read the [migration guide](/guides/v3-migration) for more details.
