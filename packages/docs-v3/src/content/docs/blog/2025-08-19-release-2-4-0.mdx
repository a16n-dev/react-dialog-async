Version 2.4.0 for React Dialog Async has been released ðŸŽ‰

## What's new?
* Dialog components are now passed a `focused` prop. This is a boolean indicating if the dialog is "focused" or not. This is useful for handling cases where multiple dialogs are open at the same time.
* Added deprecation warnings for `show()` and `hide()` methods on `useDialog()`. These methods will be removed in the next major release. [Read more here](/blog/2025/08/19/deprecating-show-hide)
* Added a deprecation warning for the `mounted` prop passed to dialog components. This prop will be removed in the next major release
