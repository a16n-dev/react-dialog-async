Version 2.1.0 for React Dialog Async has been released ðŸŽ‰

This release brings configurable options for `useDialog` to support default data and animations!

## What's new?
* `useDialog` now accepts a secondary argument for config options ([More details](/API/use-dialog#dialog-options))
* Animation support - you can now delay dialog unmounting to allow time for animations to complete ([More details](/animations))
* Default data for dialogs - you can now specify default data for dialogs ([More details](/API/use-dialog))
* Internal performance optimizations
