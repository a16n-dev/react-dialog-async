title: Multiple Dialogs
---

React Dialog Async supports multiple dialogs being shown at once. The order the dialogs are stacked is determined by the order they are opened - that is to say, the most recently opened dialog will be on top.

## Focus State
In some cases, you may want to know if a given dialog is the topmost dialog. React Dialog Async calls this dialog the *focused* dialog. Only one dialog can be focused at a time.

You can check the focus state of a dialog with the `isFocused` prop, or via
the `isFocused` value returned by the `useDialogContext()` hook.

```tsx
export const MyDialog = ({ isFocused }: AsyncDialogProps) => {

  if (!isFocused) {
    // Return something different when the dialog isn't focused
    return (...)
  }


  return <Dialog>(...)</Dialog>
}
```

## Preventing Multiple Dialogs

There is currently no support for preventing multiple dialogs from being opened at once. If this is something you would like to see supported, please raise an issue over on [GitHub](https://github.com/a16n-dev/react-dialog-async/issues).
