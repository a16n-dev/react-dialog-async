React Dialog Async is a utility library for managing dialog state, and therefore requires you to provide your own dialog components.

<Aside title={"Why doesn't React Dialog Async ship with starter components?"}>
  We expect most projects to already have a dialog component that fits their needs.

  We also believe complex dialog functionality such as focus management and accessibility is best solved by dedicated UI libraries.

## Recommended UI Libraries

If you do not already have a dialog component, you may want to consider one of these libraries:

React:
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/dialog)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-dialog/)

React Native:
- [react-native-bottom-sheet](https://gorhom.dev/react-native-bottom-sheet/)

## Creating your First Dialog Component
Dialogs for React Dialog Async are just regular react components with specific props. These props are defined by the `AsyncDialogProps` type.

```tsx title="ConfirmationDialog.tsx" "AsyncDialogProps"
import { AsyncDialogProps } from 'react-dialog-async';

export const ConfirmationDialog = ({ data, isOpen, handleClose }: AsyncDialogProps) => {
  return ...
}
```

The important props from `AsyncDialogProps` that you'll likely use are:

* `isOpen`: a boolean that indicates if the dialog is open or closed. Use this to hide/show your component accordingly.
* `handleClose`: a function that closes the dialog. Call this when you want to close the dialog, for example when the user clicks a close button or outside the dialog.
* `data`: data passed to the dialog when it was opened.
