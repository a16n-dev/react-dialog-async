title: Migrating to V3
---

Introducing React Dialog Async V3! This new major version includes an improved API, new features for more flexible use,
and much more polished documentation.

## Why V3?
React Dialog Async started out as a small library for personal use, first published over 4 years ago. At the time I was focused
on a small set of features for solving my own personal use case. Over time it's grown to support a wider range of use cases, but
the core API has remained largely unchanged since day one.

Over time as the library has matured, I've started to disagree with some of the original decisions I made. I've held off making
any breaking changes, but I feel that now is the right time to pay down some technical debt, and bundle all of the breaking changes
together into a newer, more polished version of the library.

## Breaking Changes

### `show` and `hide` methods removed from `useDialog()`

The methods returned by `useDialog()` have changed. `show` and `hide` were deprecated in `2.4.0`, and have been removed in `3.0.0` in favour of `open` and `close`.

```diff lang="tsx"

const myDialog = useDialog(MyDialog);

-await myDialog.show(...);
+await myDialog.open(...);

-await myDialog.hide();
+await myDialog.close();

```

### Updated Options for `useDialog()`

* `customKey` has been removed. This option was not used internally, and was a legacy option from early versions of the library.

* `hideOnHookUnmount` has been renamed to `persistOnUnmount`. This should be more intuitive, as setting this option to `true` will persist the dialog when the hook unmounts.

```diff lang="tsx"

const myDialog = useDialog(MyDialog, {
- customKey: 'my-dialog',

- hideOnHookUnmount: false
+ persistOnUnmount: true
});

```

### `<DialogOutlet/>` is now required

In previous versions of the library, `<DialogOutlet/>` was optional, and if it was not required, dialogs would be rendered as children of the `<DialogProvider/>`.

In V3, this is not longer the case, and `<DialogOutlet/>` is now required for dialogs to render. If one is not found, an error will be thrown when attempting to open a dialog.

```diff lang="tsx"

<DialogProvider>
  <App />
+ <DialogOutlet />
</DialogProvider>
```

### `mounted` prop removed from dialog components
The `mounted` prop passed to dialog components has been removed. This prop was always set to `true`, which made it effectively useless.

```diff lang="tsx"
- export const MyDialog = ({ mounted }: AsyncDialogProps) => {
+ export const MyDialog = ({ }: AsyncDialogProps) => {
// ...
}
```

### `open` and `focused` props renamed to `isOpen` and `isFocused`
The `open` and `focused` props passed to dialog components have been renamed to `isOpen` and `isFocused` respectively. This is to make it more clear that these props are booleans, and to differentiate them from the `open()` method returned by `useDialog()`.

```diff lang="tsx"
- export const MyDialog = ({ open, focused }: AsyncDialogProps) => {
+ export const MyDialog = ({ isOpen, isFocused }: AsyncDialogProps) => {
// ...
}
```

### defaultUnmountDelayInMs now defaults to 300ms

The `defaultUnmountDelayInMs` option for `<DialogProvider/>` now defaults to `300`. This is to provide a better out-of-the-box experience, as most dialogs will have some form of exit animation.

If you want to retain the previous behaviour, explicitly set this option to `0`.
```diff lang="tsx"
<DialogProvider
+ defaultUnmountDelayInMs={0}
/>
