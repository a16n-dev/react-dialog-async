Version 2.0.0 for React Dialog Async has been released ðŸŽ‰

This release marks the start of a new era for React Dialog Async. While the API is remaining very much the same, this release lays the foundations for some new features and improvements in the future.

We're also excited to be launching our new website (the one you're reading this on right now!!). While it's still fairly minimal at the moment, we'll be updating it over time to create more comprehensive documentation and guides. This also opens up the possibility of some more advanced APIs that would've been difficult to document in the past with a simple README.

## Breaking Changes

This release removes the `dialogKey` support we previously introduced for dialog components. While this is a useful feature, we didn't feel that it was approached in the right way. We're working on re-implementing this functionality in a more ergonomic way, so stay tuned for that in an upcoming future release.
